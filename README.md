# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview
My laboratory has partnered with Improbable Beef (a food startup) to research bacteria species that have the ability to synthesize proteins to taste like beef. Other laboratories have been successful in synthesizing beef from algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is searching for the perfect bacteria candidate to deliver the perfect taste.

My hypothesis is that the bacteria that we're searching for to deliver the perfect taste of beef, can be found on the human body. Specifically one of the types of bacteria that are found in the belly button. There has to be someone out there that has what we're looking for.

To test my hypothesis, I have sampled the navels of people from across the country to identify the bacterial species that colonize our belly-buttons. Everyone that has participated was given an ID number to remain anonymous.
